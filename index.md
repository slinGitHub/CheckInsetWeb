### Used Data Sources

**[Nightscout Project](http://www.nightscout.info)**  
Checkmate is using the Nightscout glucose data API to receive your raw glucose data and calculate and visualize the up- and downs of your current diabetic treatment status. Therefore a Nightscout database is mandatory to run Checkmate. Follow the guide here to set-up a Nightscout database [https://nightscout.github.io/](https://nightscout.github.io/).

**[xDrip+](https://jamorham.github.io)**  
XDrip (with for example the Dexcom G6) can be used to upload glucose data from the smartphone to the Nightscout cloud.
This program is not replacing any functionality of XDrip+ which can be downloaded at [Jamorham's Page](https://jamorham.github.io).
